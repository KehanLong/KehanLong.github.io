This paper introduces a novel method for the safe and efficient navigation of mobile robots in dynamic, unknown environments, utilizing onboard sensing without reconstructing accurate map representations. Traditional methods typically rely on detailed map representations to synthesize safe stabilizing controls for robot navigation, which is computationally demanding and less effective, particularly in dynamic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances in distributionally robust optimization, we propose a novel distributionally robust control barrier constraint (CBC) formulation to ensure safe navigation that directly processes LiDAR data. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in safe robot autonomy, showcasing significant efficiency gains and robustness against sensory and environmental uncertainties. Both simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, marking a substantial advancement in real-time safe navigation for mobile robots in dynamic and unknown environments.
