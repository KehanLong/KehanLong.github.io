This article presents novel methods for synthesizing distributionally robust Lyapunov-stable controllers and certificates for control systems under model uncertainty. A key challenge in designing stabilizing controllers with guarantees for uncertain systems is the accurate determination and adaptation to shifts in model parametric uncertainty during online deployment. Addressing this, we propose a novel distributionally robust formulation for the Lyapunov derivative constraint. Based on distributionally robust optimization, the Lyapunov derivative chance constraint is reformulated as deterministic convex constraints and integrated into a loss function for training the neural network-based controller. For the system governed by the learned controller, we show that the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium can be certified with high confidence, even with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) model uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method in various control problems in simulation.
