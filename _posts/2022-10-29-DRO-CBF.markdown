This paper considers enforcing safety and stability of dynamical systems in the presence of model uncertainty. We assume that only a finite set of model parametric uncertainty samples is available and formulate a distributionally robust chance-constrained program (DRCCP) for control synthesis with CBF safety and CLF stability guarantees. To facilitate efficient computation of control inputs during online execution, we present a reformulation of the DRCCP as a second-order cone program (SOCP).
