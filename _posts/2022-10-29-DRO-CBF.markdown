This work considers enforcing safety and stability of dynamical systems in the presence of model uncertainty. Safety and stability constraints may be specified using a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF), respectively. To take model uncertainty into account, robust and chance formulations of the constraints are commonly considered. However, this requires known error bounds or a known distribution for the model uncertainty, and the resulting formulations may suffer from over-conservatism or over-confidence. In this paper, we assume that only a finite set of model parametric uncertainty samples is available and formulate a distributionally robust chance-constrained program (DRCCP) for control synthesis with CBF safety and CLF stability guarantees. To facilitate efficient computation of control inputs during online execution, we present a reformulation of the DRCCP as a second-order cone program (SOCP).
