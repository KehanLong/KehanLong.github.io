This paper explores the synthesis of safe controls for dynamical systems with either probabilistic or worst-case uncertainty in both the dynamics model and the safety constraints (environments). We formulate novel probabilistic and robust (worst-case) control Lyapunov function (CLF) and control barrier function (CBF) constraints that take into account the effect of uncertainty in either case. We show that either the probabilistic or the robust (worst-case) formulation leads to a second-order cone program (SOCP), which enables efficient safe stabilizing control synthesis in real-time.
